%% Parameters for Battery State-of-Health Estimation
% 
% This example shows how to estimate the battery internal resistance and 
% state-of-health (SOH) by using an adaptive Kalman filter. The initial 
% state-of-charge (SOC) of the battery is equal to 0.6. The estimator uses 
% an initial condition for the SOC equal to 0.65. The battery keeps 
% charging and discharging for 10 hours. The unscented Kalman filter
% estimator converges to the real value of the SOC while also estimating 
% the internal resistance. To use a different Kalman filter implementation, 
% in the SOC Estimator (Kalman Filter) block, set the Filter type parameter 
% to the desired value.
